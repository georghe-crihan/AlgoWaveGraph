# Lee (aka Wave) algorithm for graph traversal demo

Ported from Watcom DOS4/GW (supposed to be still compilable with minor changes).

Compilable with ANSI C under most Unix platforms (incl. Linux, BSD, OSX and QNX)
throught the curses library (requires wide-character support, however).
```
$ cc -o wave wave.c -lncurses
$ ./wave
```

Available in Python through curses as well.

Available in JavaScript as an onlne demo, see the [html file](wave.html).
